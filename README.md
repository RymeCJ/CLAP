RELS a project to compile manga, manhua, and manhwa (comics) using links from manga scans/sites to make your life easier. 

This project is intended for Android devices.

The purpose of this project is to gather images of comics from manga scans and compile them into a single application. 
This way, you won't need multiple tabs open on your browser (e.g., Brave, Firefox, Edge) like you would when using existing 
platforms such as https://tachiyomi.org (which serves as an influence). However, one key difference with this project is 
that ads will still be present. These ads will not disrupt your experience; they will be passive and will support the manga scans 
for their revenue while you enjoying you reading time. The overall experience will be unique and distinct from the Tachiyomi platform.
I want it to be very lite wieght and open source platform

P.S. I'm a 17-year-old beginner in Java programming, and I'm eager to gain experience through this project. It's an open-source project, so I can receive help from others. and im not very optimistic for this one"
